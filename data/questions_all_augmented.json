It cannot “think,” understand, or act beyond what it was programmed to do. Example: recommendation systems like Netflix or YouTube. General AI represents a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence capable of learning, understanding, and solving any intellectual task like a human.

    "rubric": "argumentative",
    "answer": "Lack of conscience and empathy. AI has no self‑awareness, doesn’t understand human suffering, emotion, or moral context. Ethics involve understanding not just rules, but intentions and moral consequences, which a machine cannot truly perceive.\n\nEthics is contextual and sometimes ambiguous. A real ethical situation can have multiple interpretations, and AI cannot analyze moral nuances, dilemmas, or situations where all options are problematic (e.g., the trolley dilemma).\n\nDependency on pre‑existing data and rules. AI makes decisions based on data and algorithms created by humans. If data is incomplete, incorrect, or biased, decisions may be deeply unethical even if they seem “logically” sound.\n\nRisk of abuse and lack of accountability. If we allow AI to make ethical decisions, who is held responsible when something goes wrong? A machine cannot be held accountable, and shifting decision‑making from humans to algorithms can be dangerous in critical contexts (e.g., justice, health, security)."

    "question": "To what extent do online personalization algorithms affect users' autonomy?",

    "answer": "Online personalization algorithms can significantly affect user autonomy because they influence what users see, choose, and believe, often without their awareness. At some point, users may be unconsciously placed in an information bubble where they receive only content that confirms their opinions, preferences, and past behavior. This phenomenon limits exposure to new ideas and reduces the ability to make informed free decisions."

    "answer": "A machine that passes the Turing Test may be convincing, but that does not mean it is intelligent in a human sense. It does not think, does not understand, and has no intentions. Therefore, it is not correct to consider it truly “intelligent,” only able to simulate intelligence in a very narrow context."

    "rubric": "argumentative",
    "answer": "Since there is a margin of error for any intelligent system, we should classify the answer based on the definition of 'responsible'. If the system has a success rate above 99%, the 1% error might be insignificant—so yes. But if it’s used regularly in a high-risk domain like controlling a nuclear plant, then it would be irresponsible even with a 1% chance of failure."

    "answer": "Online personalization algorithms significantly affect users' autonomy by limiting choices and influencing decisions through displayed content. For example, on social networks or news platforms, users see only information that confirms their beliefs (so-called 'filter bubbles'), reducing opinion diversity and the ability to make informed choices. While personalization can improve the digital experience, it can also lead to manipulation, addiction, or even radicalization, thus undermining real freedom of choice. Users should have transparency and control over how these algorithms function."

    "answer": "It is not necessarily correct to consider that a machine that passes the Turing Test is 'intelligent' in the human sense. The Turing Test evaluates whether a machine can imitate human conversational behavior, not whether it truly understands what it says. A machine may pass the test using advanced language processing algorithms without having consciousness, intent, or real understanding. True intelligence involves more than appearances: it requires reasoning, emotions, values, and deep adaptability — things AI does not genuinely possess.

    "rubric": "technical",
    "answer": "1. Collect initial information (Facts): The system receives a set of facts from the user or environment. These represent the initial knowledge state. 2. Select inference strategy: The system chooses how to apply rules from the knowledge base. Two main strategies are: Forward Chaining – starts from facts and applies rules to derive conclusions; Backward Chaining – starts from a hypothesis and checks if it can be deduced from current facts. 3. Search for applicable rules: The system scans the rule base and identifies rules whose conditions match the current facts. Applicable rules are activated. 4. Select and apply rule: If multiple rules are applicable, a conflict resolution strategy is used (e.g., most specific, most recent, or highest priority). The selected rule is applied and generates new facts. 5. Update fact base: Newly generated facts are added to the fact base. The process restarts from step 3. 6. Check goal: The system checks if the desired goal or conclusion has been reached. If yes, the process ends; if not, it continues. 7. Stop condition: The search ends when: the goal is reached; no more applicable rules exist; a time or resource limit is reached."
